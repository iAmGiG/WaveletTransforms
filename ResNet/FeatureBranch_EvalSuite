# ImageNet-1k Test Suite Documentation

## Overview

Provide a brief description of the purpose of the test suite, its relevance to the ImageNet-1k dataset, and the main goals of the suite.

## Features

Detail the key features of the test suite, including:

- **Image Loading**: Describe how images are loaded and preprocessed.
- **Label Mapping**: Explain how labels are derived from the filenames or a separate file.
- **Model Evaluation**: Outline how the model is evaluated using the dataset.

## Current Implementation

Summarize the current implementation, including:

- **Directory Structure**: Describe the expected directory structure.
- **Data Loader**: Explain the DataLoader setup.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: List the metrics used for evaluating model performance.

## Challenges Faced

Discuss the challenges encountered during the implementation:

- **File Naming and Class ID Extraction**: Issues with extracting correct class IDs from filenames.
- **Label Accuracy**: Concerns about the correctness of label assignments.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Any issues related to how images are preprocessed.

## Debugging Steps

Outline the steps taken to debug issues, including:

- **Detailed Debug Prints**: Use of debug prints to trace the flow and catch errors.
- **Validation of Path and Files**: Checks to ensure the correct path and file extensions.
- **Sample Tests**: Use of a subset of data to quickly test and iterate.

## Future Enhancements

Propose future enhancements or features to be added to the test suite:

- **Automated Testing**: Integration of automated tests to run before updates are merged.
- **Performance Optimization**: Suggestions for optimizing data loading and processing.
- **Extended Metrics**: Additional metrics for more granular performance evaluation.
