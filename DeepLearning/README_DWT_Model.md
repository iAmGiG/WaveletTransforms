# DWT Model Training Instructions

This document outlines how adjusting the batch size impacts the training of models utilizing Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for weight compression and provides instructions for running the code with flags.
Where you call the model.fit() method under the train with dwt model.

## Impact of Batch Size on DWT Models

Adjusting the batch size affects the number of samples that are processed before the model's internal parameters are updated.

- **Batch Size Increase**: Leads to faster training but might reduce the model's ability to generalize from DWT-compressed weights due to smoother convergence and higher memory usage.
Raising Batch Size: Increasing the batch size will generally
    lead to faster epoch times since there are fewer updates to be made.
- **Batch Size Decrease**: Potentially improves the model's performance with DWT-compressed weights through better generalization, albeit with increased training time and lower memory demand.
Lowering Batch Size: Decreasing the batch size often
    leads to longer training times since the model's parameters are updated more frequently.

## Running the Code

To train the model with customized settings, use the following command-line flags:

- `--wavelet`: Specifies the type of wavelet for DWT (default: 'haar').
- `--batch_size`: Determines the batch size for training (e.g., 32).
- `--epochs`: Sets the number of training epochs (e.g., 10).
- `--save_dir`: Directory to save trained models (default: './DeepLearning/SavedDWTModels').

Example command:

```sh
python DWT_model.py --wavelet haar --batch_size 32 --epochs 10 --save_dir ./SavedModels
```

### Wavelet Types

- **Haar:** Known for its simplicity and discontinuity, resembling a step function. Ideal for quick experiments and edge detection.

- **Daubechies:** Offers compactly supported orthonormal wavelets, suitable for practical discrete wavelet analysis. Identified by dbN, where N is the order.

- **Biorthogonal:** Features linear phase properties, making it suitable for signal and image reconstruction tasks.

- **Coiflets:** Designed by Daubechies, these wavelets have both wavelet and scaling functions with a certain number of vanishing moments, supporting signal smoothness.

- **Symlets:** Nearly symmetrical, these are modified versions of Daubechies wavelets, aiming for less asymmetry.

- **Morlet:** Known for not having a scaling function, explicit in form, and useful for frequency analysis.

- **Mexican Hat:** Also known as the Ricker wavelet, derived from the second derivative of the Gaussian function, useful for 2D and 3D data analysis.

- **Meyer:** Defined in the frequency domain, suited for smooth transitions between pass and stop bands.

#### future consideration

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** While you have provided flags for adjusting the batch size, epochs, and wavelet type, you could consider implementing a more systematic approach to hyperparameter tuning. This could involve techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for your model.

- **Cross-Validation:** To ensure the robustness and generalization capability of your model, you could implement cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation. This would help you evaluate your model's performance on multiple splits of the data and provide a more reliable estimate of its generalization ability.

- **Early Stopping:** Implementing an early stopping mechanism during training could help prevent overfitting and potentially improve the model's performance. You could monitor the validation loss or accuracy and stop training when these metrics plateau or start to degrade.

- **Learning Rate Scheduling:** Experimenting with different learning rate schedules, such as step decay, exponential decay, or cyclical learning rates, could lead to faster convergence and potentially better performance.

- **Data Augmentation:** If your dataset is relatively small or lacks diversity, you could consider applying data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, flipping, or adding noise, to artificially increase the size and diversity of your training data.

- **Model Ensembling:** Instead of training a single model, you could explore ensemble techniques, such as bagging or boosting, to combine multiple DWT-compressed models and potentially improve overall performance.

- **Visualizations and Interpretability:** Adding visualizations and interpretability techniques, such as activation maps or saliency maps, could provide insights into how the DWT-compressed weights affect the model's behavior and decision-making process.

- **Regularization Techniques:** Exploring different regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, dropout, or batch normalization, could help prevent overfitting and potentially improve the model's generalization ability.

- **Transfer Learning:** If you have access to pre-trained models or larger datasets, you could consider leveraging transfer learning techniques to initialize your model's weights with pre-trained values and fine-tune them on your specific task.

- **Distributed Training:** If you have access to multiple GPUs or a distributed computing environment, you could explore distributed training strategies to accelerate the training process and potentially handle larger batch sizes or more complex models.
