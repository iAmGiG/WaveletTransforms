TODO: show the linear relationship of pruning and threshold dropping.

at what point do we see a large accuracy drop?

# Define Flags.
FLAGS = flags.FLAGS
'''
- Wavelet: Type of wavelet to use for the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).
    The choice of wavelet affects the base wavelet function used in the DWT,
    which can impact the model's ability to learn from data that has been decomposed in different ways.
    Different wavelets capture different characteristics of the input data,
    potentially influencing the features learned by the model.
- Save Directory: Directory to save the trained models.
    If you want to save models to the default location (./SavedDWTModels),
    you need to be in the DeepLearning folder when running the script.
    Otherwise, it will create a new folder and subdirectories in the current working directory.
    This flag determines where the trained models are stored for future use or analysis.
- Batch size: Batch size for training.
    This determines the number of samples that will be propagated through 
        the neural network at once during the training process.
    A larger batch size requires more memory 
        but can lead to faster training and smoother updates to the model's weights.
    However, very large batch sizes can also degrade generalization performance.
- Epochs: Number of epochs or iterations over the entire training dataset.
    This specifies how many times the learning algorithm will 
        work through the entire training dataset.
    More epochs can lead to better convergence and potentially higher accuracy,
    but also increase the risk of overfitting if not appropriately regularized.
- Levels: Decomposition level for the DWT.
    A higher level results in a deeper decomposition of the input data,
        affecting the granularity of the wavelet transform applied to the input data.
    Higher levels may capture more abstract features 
        but also increase computational complexity and the risk of overfitting.
- Threshold: Threshold for thresholding the wavelet coefficients obtained from the DWT.
    A value of 0 means no thresholding is applied, 
        while the maximum value corresponds to the absolute value 
        of the largest wavelet coefficient. 
    Thresholding controls the sparsity of the wavelet coefficients,
    potentially impacting the interpretability of the learned features 
        and the model's ability to generalize.
