# Project Checklist

## Preparation

- [ ] Review literature on DWT and its application in neural network compression.
- [ ] Select a simple deep learning model architecture for initial experiments.
- [ ] Choose an appropriate dataset from Hugging Face for the task.

## Experimentation

- [ ] Train the selected model on the chosen dataset to establish a baseline performance metric.
- [ ] Apply DWT to the model's weight matrices to increase sparsity.
- [ ] Retrain the model post-DWT application and compare performance to the baseline.
    - [ ] Evaluate classification accuracy before and after DWT application.
    - [ ] Assess model size reduction and efficiency improvements.

## Analysis

- [ ] Document the comparative performance in a structured manner.
- [ ] Use visual aids to demonstrate the impact of DWT on model performance and size.
- [ ] Analyze the results to determine the effectiveness of DWT in neural network compression.

## Iteration and Refinement

- [ ] Based on analysis, refine the DWT application process for optimization.
- [ ] Consider adjustments in the thresholding process for better sparsity without significant loss in performance.
- [ ] Explore different wavelets or transformation techniques as necessary.

## Documentation and Sharing

- [ ] Update the project README with findings and methodology.
- [ ] Prepare visual documentation to share with peers and advisors for feedback.
- [ ] Outline next steps based on project outcomes and feedback received.
